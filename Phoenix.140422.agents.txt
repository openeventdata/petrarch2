# CAMEO agents file for PETRARCH automated coding system
#
# This dictionary is provided by the Computational Event Data System Project:
# http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com.
#
# Information on the CAMEO coding ontology is available at 
# http://eventdata.parusanalytics.com/data.dir/cameo.html.
#
# Provenance: This has been accumulated from a variety of different sources, starting
# with initial source-based work (that is, finding specific agents in news reports;
# this also accounts for incorrect variants on spellings: these were found somewhere)
# at Kansas, then extensive work with WordNet, which accounts for some of the 
# archaic constructions, notably for [~CRM].
#
# This version of the file assumes the automatic creation of regular noun forms found in 
# PETRARCH 0.5, so regular plurals have been removed. Most nouns are stopped ("_") rather 
# than stemmed (e.g. "MINISTR ") but a few stems remain.
#
# Known problems
# 1. Not all alternatives for American/British spelling are included
# 2. Not all non-terminal plurals (e.g. CHAMBERS_OF_COMMERCE) are included
# 3. Hyphenated versions of PRO, ANTI and other prefixes are not complete
# 4. A couple of very simple substitution rules could eliminate a bunch of these: expect 
#    this to be forthcoming, though not in TABARI
#
# Funding for CAMEO has been provided by the National Science  Foundation (SES-0096086, 
# SES-0455158, SES-0527564, SES-1004414, SES-1259190) and grants from the University of 
# Kansas General Research Fund.
